Though it feels unpleasant, and people will sometimes ridicule you for it, the more you feel like a noob, the better. When I was young, I thought old people had everything figured out. Now that I'm old, I know this isn't true. It made sense for humans to dislike the feeling of being a noob, just as, in a world where food was scarce, it made sense for them to dislike the feeling of being hungry.
